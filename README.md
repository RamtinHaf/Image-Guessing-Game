On the dashboard you can choose to play three different game modes, multiplayer, singleplayer and against the ai. For multiplayer and singleplayer there is a table with games that are waiting for players. You can start or join a game as a proposer or guesser but against the ai only as a guesser. On the right side there is a leaderboard with the top ten all time players.
